# UUV-control-problem
Simulation study on UUV control
This repository contains MATLAB code for trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs).
The code implements control algorithms to enable accurate path following while avoiding known or unknown obstacles in the underwater environment.
